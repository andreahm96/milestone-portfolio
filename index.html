                <h5>Hi there, </h5>
                <p>My name is andrea and I have recently converted to the world of web development and web design. Before becoming a complete coding geek, I worked in various different positions in the business field. It wasnâ€™t until i took charge of a small business (with a very outdated website) that I realized I enjoyed web work so much. From then on it was love at first code and I took a deep dive into the world of tech. I enrolled in skillcrush, an online coding school, and trained to develop my design and coding skills.</p>
                <p>In addition to my passion for web design/development, I am also an avid traveler. One of the things that actually attracted me to this field was the possibility to work from anywhere in the world. Moving throughout different countries is what continually inspires me in the artistic side of web design and my appetite to constantly change my surroundings motivates me to always evolve and continually learn as a web developer. </p>
